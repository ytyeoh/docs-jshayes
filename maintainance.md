# Website Maintenance & Content Management  

We charge RM800 per day for tasks handled on demand. Below are some scenarios that can typically be completed within a day.

## File Upload  
WordPress has a size limit for uploads, which could include images, PDFs, or videos. We provide support to ensure the related content is properly displayed on the website.

## Staging Server  
Sync content/changes from the staging server to the production server. The staging server is used to display and test new features or view updated content before publishing directly to the production server. We will manage the database and ensure all related new files are synced to the production server.

## WordPress Update  
Approximately every 3–4 years, WordPress releases a major version update, and minor updates occur every 4–6 months. You can refer to [WordPress Versions](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-versions/) for detailed information on these updates.

## Plugin Update  
The update frequency for plugins varies depending on WordPress versions. After a WordPress update, it is essential to ensure that all plugins are compatible with the new version.

## Malware/Virus Infection  
When a website is affected by malware, we typically block access to the entire site until the malware is cleaned. Once cleaned from the client’s side, the site will be reopened. In such cases, we assist in removing malware to get the website back online as soon as possible.

## Plugin Install

Plugin price might ve vary depend on plugin, because some plugin need subscription. Plugin install for 2FA is RM150 one off is only basic mode.
